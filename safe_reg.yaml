STM32F4xx:
  type: family
  description: STM32F4 family from ST Microelectronics. Based on a Cortex M4F core.
  # Byte-size of all registers in this family. May also be applied at a per-chip, per-peripheral,
  # and per-register level.
  register_size: 4
  RCC:
    # Peripherals may be defined both at the family level and at the chip level. A chip level
    # definition will override any overlapping fields from the family level definition. This can be
    # used to define common traits once in the family and chip specific traits in the chip. As long
    # as the name of the peripheral is the same it will be treated as one peripheral.
    type: peripheral
    description: Reset and Clock Control peripheral for STM32F4xx family.
    # "base_address" must be defined at the peripheral level (either in the family or in the chip).
    # Except if all registers in the peripheral define "address", in which case they override the
    # base address + offset.
    base_address: 0x40023800
    CR:
      type: register
      description: RCC clock control register
      # Either "offset" or "address" must be defined for all registers (not both). If "address" is
      # defined the owning peripheral's "base_address" will be ignored for that register. If
      # "offset" is defined the owning peripheral must define "base_address".
      offset: 0x00
      # "reset" is optional at register level. In this case RCC_CR contains undefined reset values,
      # so "reset" is defined in each bitset that has a valid reset value. This allows us to reset
      # only the bitsets that have defined reset values.
      # "reset" may not be defined in any bitset if it is defined at the register level. If "reset"
      # is defined for the register, then a reset will just overwrite the whole register.

      # "access" is optional at the register level. If it is not defined for a bitset the default
      # register level value will be used.
      access: rw
      HSION:
        type: bitset
        offset: 0 # Required. Bit offset from the 0th bit in the register.
        length: 1 # Required. Number of bits in this bitset.
        reset: 0x01 # Optional, see note above.
        access: rw # Required. May be either "r", "w", or "rw".
        # "values" defines any values that may be used to set or compare against the value in
        # a bitset. It also defines valid and invalid values for doing validation checks (see
        # below).
        #
        # Values may be either named or unnamed. Named values may be specified by a list of
        # name/value pairs. An unnamed range may be specified by using the special object "range"
        # and specifying a "start" and an "end". Named values must not be mixed with an unnamed
        # range.
        #
        # Any values within a bitset that are not specified are defaulted to invalid. With a
        # special case when the "values" field is not specified, in which case all values are
        # considered valid.
        #
        # Examples:
        # ```
        # # Named values. All unspecified values are considered invalid.
        # values:
        #   - named_value1: 0x01
        #   - named_value2: 0x02
        #   - named_value3: 0x03
        #
        # # Unnamed range. All values outside the range are considered invalid.
        # values:
        #   range:
        #     - start: 0x01
        #     - end: 0x0F
